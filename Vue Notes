Good to know:
- Using a cdn, you can just include the following to use vue without installing it: <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>

- In the network tab, you can use the no throttling dropdown to test out your code with various network throughput.
- You can use v-cloak to hide the loading of a element, for example when it originally loaded the firstname, you would see {{}} before John Doe, to fix this you can add a    v-cloak to a div and set a custom css for it like so: div v-cloak.  Css: [v-cloak] { display:none} do this in main.css

- v-bind:href is the same as :href, this allows us to bind elements to certain logic/code

- by adding @keyup.enter to a input, you can have vue trigger that field ona specific key interaction(enter, space, etc)

- trim removes whitespace from input v-model.lazy.trim

- Computed properties: data-bind certain information together by using a computed property, good for reactive data, it helps to simplify logic: https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html#basic-example

- A computed property is a value that can be derived from other stored value. It calculates or computes from other values resulting in a new property. 

- Watchers:


- v-show changes the display css property, if false,t hen display will be set to none, does not work with v-else, does not work with template/template

- v-if will remove or add the element depending on the conditon, works with v-else, works with template, cheap on load, expensive on toggle
